"""
Geographic Scope Filter for Business Discovery Engine V3.

Single decision point that keeps discovery results inside the user-selected
city/district scope. Wraps the LocationValidator (which owns the matching
heuristics) so the scraper orchestrator depends on one honest policy object
instead of scattering address checks across the pipeline.

Why this exists: Google Maps text search is relevance-ranked over the whole
metro area — a search bound to 'Ataşehir' routinely returns prominent
businesses from neighboring districts (Ümraniye, Kartal, Kadıköy...). Without
a post-extraction fence those places were ingested labeled with the REQUESTED
district instead of their real one.
